#### NestJS ConfigService Vs Environment Variables?

The NestJS ConfigService and environment variables are both ways to manage configuration in a NestJS application, but they serve slightly different purposes and have different advantages.

Environment Variables:

Environment variables are a universal way to pass configuration values into an application. They are easy to use and are supported by virtually all hosting platforms. They are particularly useful for storing sensitive information, like database passwords, that should not be included in your code.

However, environment variables can be difficult to manage as the number of variables grows, and they don't provide any type safety or validation.

NestJS ConfigService:

The ConfigService is a NestJS module that provides a more sophisticated way to manage configuration. It can read values from environment variables, but it can also read from .env files, which can be easier to manage. It also supports validation and type safety, which can help prevent bugs.

The ConfigService also supports asynchronous configuration, which can be useful if you need to fetch configuration values from a remote service.

In the provided code, the ConfigService is used to read values from environment variables. This gives you the flexibility of environment variables, with the added benefits of the ConfigService.

In general, it's a good idea to use the ConfigService for most of your configuration needs, and fall back to raw environment variables only when necessary.
