### Azure API Management Service

Azure API Management is a fully managed service that helps you to publish, secure, transform, maintain, and monitor APIs. With Azure API Management, you can take any backend system, hosted anywhere, and expose it through a secure and scalable API.

Here are some of the key features of Azure API Management:

1. **API Gateway**: The API gateway is the endpoint that:
   - Accepts API calls and routes them to your backends.
   - Verifies API keys, JWT tokens, certificates, and other credentials.
   - Enforces usage quotas and rate limits.
   - Transforms your API on the fly without code modifications.
   - Caches backend responses where set up.

2. **Developer portal**: An automatically generated, fully customizable website with the documentation of your APIs.

3. **Security**: Protect your APIs by setting up a security policy that can include IP filtering, limiting call rates based on a subscription key, JWT token validation, and more.

4. **Analytics**: Get insights into usage and health of your APIs with the help of Azure Monitor and Azure Application Insights.

5. **Developer productivity**: Import API schemas, simulate API behavior, and generate API definitions.

6. **Integration**: Azure API Management can be integrated with Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, or any other RESTful API.

7. **Scalability and Performance**: Azure API Management is scalable and can handle any amount of load. It also provides response caching to improve performance.

8. **Protocols**: Azure API Management supports both RESTful and SOAP APIs.

In the context of your NestJS application, you can use Azure API Management to expose your User Management API, apply policies like rate limiting and authentication, and monitor its usage.


### Configure authentication for my APIs in Azure API Management

To configure authentication for your APIs in Azure API Management, you can use policies. Policies are a powerful capability of the system that allow the publisher to change the behavior of the API through configuration. Policies are a collection of statements that are executed sequentially on the request or response of an API.

Here's an example of how you can configure a policy to validate JWT tokens:

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" failed-validation-httpcode="401" failed-validation-error-message="Unauthorized. Access token is missing or invalid.">
            <openid-config url="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/.well-known/openid-configuration" />
            <required-claims>
                <claim name="aud">
                    <value>{your-api-management-service-name}</value>
                </claim>
            </required-claims>
        </validate-jwt>
        <base />
    </inbound>
    <backend>
        <base />
    </backend>
    <outbound>
        <base />
    </outbound>
    <on-error>
        <base />
    </on-error>
</policies>
```

In this example, the `validate-jwt` policy is used to validate JWT tokens from the `Authorization` header. The `openid-config` element is used to specify the OpenID Connect discovery endpoint, which returns the public keys used to sign the JWT tokens. The `required-claims` element is used to specify the required claims in the JWT tokens.

Replace `{tenant}` with your Azure AD tenant ID, and `{your-api-management-service-name}` with the name of your API Management service.

You can apply this policy to all APIs, a single API, a single operation, or a product using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or the REST API.

Please note that this is just an example. The actual configuration depends on your specific requirements and the authentication method you want to use.


### Configure rate limiting for my APIs in Azure API Management

To configure rate limiting for your APIs in Azure API Management, you can use the `rate-limit` or `rate-limit-by-key` policies. These policies enforce a limit on the number of calls that an API can accept within a specified time period.

Here's an example of how you can configure a policy to limit the rate of calls to 1000 calls per hour:

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <rate-limit calls="1000" renewal-period="60" />
        <base />
    </inbound>
    <backend>
        <base />
    </backend>
    <outbound>
        <base />
    </outbound>
    <on-error>
        <base />
    </on-error>
</policies>
```

In this example, the `rate-limit` policy is used to limit the rate of calls to 1000 calls per hour. The `calls` attribute specifies the number of calls, and the `renewal-period` attribute specifies the time period in minutes.

You can apply this policy to all APIs, a single API, a single operation, or a product using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or the REST API.

Please note that this is just an example. The actual configuration depends on your specific requirements and the rate limit you want to enforce.


### Configure caching for my APIs in Azure API Management

In Azure API Management, you can configure caching to improve performance and reduce the load on your backend services. By default, Azure API Management includes a cache that is co-located with the API Management gateway component.

To configure caching for a specific API or operation, you can use the `cache-lookup` and `cache-store` policies. The `cache-lookup` policy is used to retrieve the response from the cache, and the `cache-store` policy is used to store the response in the cache.

Here's an example of how you can configure a policy to cache responses for 10 minutes:

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <base />
    </inbound>
    <backend>
        <base />
    </backend>
    <outbound>
        <cache-lookup vary-by-developer="false" vary-by-developer-groups="false" downstream-caching-type="none">
            <vary-by-header>Accept</vary-by-header>
            <vary-by-header>User-Agent</vary-by-header>
        </cache-lookup>
        <cache-store duration="10" />
        <base />
    </outbound>
    <on-error>
        <base />
    </on-error>
</policies>
```

In this example, the `cache-lookup` policy is used to retrieve the response from the cache. The `vary-by-header` elements specify that the cache entry varies by the `Accept` and `User-Agent` headers. The `cache-store` policy is used to store the response in the cache for 10 minutes.

You can apply this policy to all APIs, a single API, a single operation, or a product using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or the REST API.

Please note that this is just an example. The actual configuration depends on your specific requirements and the caching strategy you want to use.
